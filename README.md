Project Statement- This project uses various techniques such as frequency analysis, exploratory
analysis and visualizations, from which we are forecasting power
consumption

Project Abstract- We used combined model of ARIMA on over pre-processed data and
tune different parameter for forecasting of frequency

Steps Involved;
i)   We have extracted the data from the North Eastern Regional Load Despatch Centre (NERLDC) and then
pre-processed the dataset obtain from the site above.<br>
ii)  Plotting the frequency of electricity against december can provide insights into the variation
of electricity supply.<br>
iii) Plotting the frequency of electricity over date can provide insights into the temporal patterns
and dynamics of electricity usage.<br>
iv) TRAINING MODELS :- First we use the ARIMA for time series data set.<br>
